function P = population(n, base)
% n = population size
% base is modN, where N can be 1, 2, 3, .... (e.g., 40)
    % ((e^2*pi*1i*k/N))


% I am deciding to create a population that is the size of 20 (amount of rows)

% I can decide the amount of bits I want too (i just chose 20 also... maybe
% there is a better choice). 


    P = round(rand(n,base));


    
end
